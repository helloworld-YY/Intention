This is the code of punished-weighted naive Bayes for implicit intention inference, please cite [1].
P_io.txt and P_i.txt are obtained by statistical analysis from experimental data.
w.mat is the weight matrix in class-specific attribute weighted naive Bayes.

test.m  is  the main function and the acc is the mean inference accuracy.
